# Gym Workout App
## Project Overview:
In today's gyms, people often struggle to decide which workout to do, especially when equipment is in use or when unsure about the right exercise for their fitness goals. To solve this problem, I developed a Gym Workout App that provides users with personalized workout recommendations based on various factors.

## How it Works:
Using a dataset gathered from Kaggle and other reliable sources, I built a machine learning pipeline to filter exercises according to the user's specific needs. The app takes into account factors like fitness goals, available time, and group size to suggest highly-rated exercises that best fit the user's requirements.

## Key Features:

* Workout Recommendations: Get workout suggestions tailored to your fitness goals, whether it's strength building, endurance, or flexibility.
* Workout Details: The app provides detailed descriptions for each workout, including the number of sets, repetitions, and proper form.
* Visual Guidance: Each workout is accompanied by a GIF demonstrating the correct movement, ensuring that users can perform exercises with the right technique.
* User-Friendly Interface: The app allows users to input their preferences, such as how many days they want to work out, their workout goal, and the number of exercises they wish to do per day.
